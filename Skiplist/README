Sample Execution.

This program is tested for 4 levels of list.
Please dis-regard the code for pretty printing. I hacked it into printing levels in such a way that,
it is clear to the naked eye what node points to what, at what level.

=====================================SAMPLE OUTPUT=====================================

azkaban-pro:~/Dropbox/programs/Skiplist [$ ./skiplist 9 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17
size 9
The current skip list is:
1>3>5>7>9>11131517
1-->5-->9-->13->17
1------>9------>17
1-------------->17

Enter a value to search this skiplist:
5
Finding 5 in the above skiplist
5 found



azkaban-pro:~/Dropbox/programs/Skiplist [$ ./skiplist 9 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17

1>3>5>7>9>11131517
1-->5-->9-->13->17
1------>9------>17
1-------------->17

Enter a value to search this skiplist:

=================================END OF SAMPLE OUTPUT==================================



In the above invocation, in the output, the links point to the levels and currently the skiplist has 4 levels.

1>3>5>7>9>11131517
1-->5-->9-->13->17
1------>9------>17
1-------------->17
