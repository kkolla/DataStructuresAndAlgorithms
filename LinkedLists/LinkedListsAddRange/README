You are given a list of size N, initialized with zeroes. You have to perform M operations on the list and output the maximum of final values of all the N elements in the list. For every operation, you are given three integers a, b and k and you have to add value k to all the elements ranging from index a to b(both inclusive).

Input Format
First line will contain two integers N and M separated by a single space.
Next M lines will contain three integers a, b and k separated by a single space.
Numbers in list are numbered from 1 to N.

Output Format
A single line containing maximum value in the updated list.

Constraints

3≤N≤107
1≤M≤2∗105
1≤a≤b≤N
0≤k≤109

Sample Input #00

5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
Sample Output #00

200
Explanation

After first update list will be 100 100 0 0 0.
After second update list will be 100 200 100 100 100.
After third update list will be 100 200 200 200 100.
So the required answer will be 200.
